### DISPUTE RESOLUTION

#### Agreement to Arbitrate

**YOU AND ENLIGHTEN MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION. This will prohibit you from bringing any class, collective, or consolidated action against Enlighten, and will also prohibit you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future such actions brought against Enlighten by someone else. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court: there is no judge or jury in arbitration; discovery in arbitration may be more limited than discovery in litigation; and court review of an arbitration award is limited.**

This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) also applies to claims between you and Enlighten’s Clients or Retailers, and such Clients or Retailers will be considered intended third party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.

You and Enlighten agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy, whether based on past, present or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof); the Enlighten Services and website; Content currently or previously available on or through the Enlighten Services and website; your relationship with Enlighten; your User Data; the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation, or termination of your Account or this Agreement; payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you; and any other federal and state statutory and common law claims (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Dispute (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforce-ability, legality, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) will be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided herein.

YOU UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT YOU AND ENLIGHTEN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

#### Prohibition of Class Actions And Non-individualized Relief

You acknowledge and agree that you and Enlighten are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class, collective, or consolidated proceeding. Further, unless both you and Enlighten otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, collective, consolidated or representative proceeding.

#### Arbitration Rules and Governing Law

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or any subsequent applicable telephone number. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. It is your and Enlighten’s intent that the FAA and AAA Rules will preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue will be resolved under the laws of the State of Delaware. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the AAA Rules or FAA.

#### Arbitration Process

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents at adr.org. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

#### Arbitration Location And Procedure

Unless you and Enlighten otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Enlighten submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

#### Arbitrator’s Decision

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The prevailing party in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.

#### Fees

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

#### Severability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis, and (3) to the extent that any Disputes must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated or representative basis, such Disputes must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. In any case in which the Dispute proceeds on a class, collective, consolidated or representative basis and there is also a final judicial determination that this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable as to a portion (but not all) of such Dispute, then such portion of the Dispute will be severed from any remaining claims and the remainder will be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Disputes to the fullest extent possible. Except as otherwise provided herein, this “Arbitration Agreement” section will survive any termination of this Agreement.

#### Changes

Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Enlighten changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending us a notice to Enlighten’s Legal Department at legal@getenlightened.io with “Legal” in the subject line within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated above or in the date of Enlighten’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Enlighten in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement). If you do not opt out by the deadline, you are agreeing to the arbitration process as set forth in the new Agreement.
