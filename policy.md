## ENLIGHTEN

Last Updated: May 19, 2020

Thank you for working with Enlighten. We are passionate about ensuring our clients and their customers are provided with best-in-class technology (“Enlighten Services”) to help deliver the best-in-class service to all. We do this by partnering with our clients which in many cases are retail locations (both online and in-person) (“Retailers”) with verified consumers (“Customers”) and certain other third parties, including technologies and data providers (“Third Party Providers”).

Our goal with this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we collect about you (also known as “User Data”) and describe how we use that information to provide you and all of our clients, Third Party Providers, and Retailers with data related to Enlighten Services. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in our Terms and Conditions, including any agreements incorporated by reference within the Terms and Conditions (the “Enlighten Terms”). Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning given to them in our Terms and Conditions. If you do not feel comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy or our Terms and Conditions, you may opt-out of certain of the Enlighten Services and terminate your Account. Certain parts of this Privacy Policy apply only to the Enlighten Services as defined in the Terms; please see below for information specific to California Residents.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Please note, not all features are available in all locations, so some of the examples below may not apply to you. In addition, the information we collect depends on how you interact with us.

#### Information You Provide To Us

We collect information about you when you provide it to us directly, when we request it from you, or when you give us permission to get it from a third-party source. Below are some examples of the types of information we collect.

#### Website Visits

When you visit Enlighten, a Third-Party Provider, or a Retailer’s website, the servers automatically collect certain technical information about your including your Internet protocol address and information about your device, including device identifiers (such as MAC address), your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version, device types, device model and manufacturer, and your device operating system type and version. As further described in the Cookies and Similar Technologies section below, we collect and store such mobile IDs, and other data.

#### Registration and Identity Verification

When you visit a Third-Party Provider or Retailer, or a website hosted by either of those entities, you give us your name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and, if necessary, a copy of your government-issued ID (i.e. your driver’s license, state ID card, or passport). In order to receive a delivery or shipment, you must provide a valid delivery address — whether that’s your home address or any other valid physical address. Additional information we receive from you may include, but is not limited to, a state-issued medical marijuana ID card or a physician’s recommendation letter that you provide us in order to receive a medical delivery, or a selfie image to improve trust and safety while utilizing the Enlighten Services.

#### Demographic Information

We also collect demographic information from you when you register, shop at a Retailer, when you take Customer surveys, and throughout your use of the Enlighten Services. Demographic information may include your age, gender, location, how you heard about Enlighten, the Retailer or Third-Party Provider, spending habits, consumption preferences, and other preferences or habits.

#### Communications

If you contact us directly, we may collect information from you that helps us provide a satisfying experience and answers any questions you have. For example, when you communicate with a member of our customer service team, or at the Retailer level, you may be asked you for your name, email address, delivery address, phone number, or proof of charge in order to identify your account, confirm your identity, or assist with your issue. If you send us an email, the contents of the email will be collected, as will any other information you choose to provide with your email. If you communicate with us via live chat, that correspondence will be archived. If you communicate with us via social media, we collect that communication and associate that information with your user account to the extent the information can be linked. Customer service communications over the phone may be recorded for quality control purposes and may be summarized within our customer support systems.

#### Payment Information

Payment information may be collected in connection with a transaction facilitated by the Retailer or Third-Party Provider. In some cases, for on-demand delivery, all payments are made to a licensed cannabis retail dispensary fulfilling your order, and not to Enlighten. For other products and offerings, payments may be made directly to Enlighten or another third party. In all cases, while we may retain a limited amount of payment information for identification and convenience, to keep your financial data secure, full payment or financial information is not stored. Unless otherwise noted, payment information flows through a third-party vendor who processes the payments for Retailers and Enlighten (where utilized).

#### Voluntary User Surveys

From time to time, we may invite you to fill out voluntary user surveys or to participate in focus groups to provide feedback on various topics, which may include, without limitation: your experiences with Enlighten and/or our partners and Retailers, your experience with the Enlighten Services, available products, new offerings, your preferences related to cannabis, and your sentiments on public policy or other cannabis industry topics. These surveys are often conducted by Enlighten or third-party market research firms, who collect such data on our behalf, to analyze industry preferences and trends. Enlighten does not share your survey information on an individualized basis, but as described below, retains the right to utilize the data in an anonymized manner for, among other activities, business development, marketing and investment opportunities.

#### Applicant Data

When you apply to a job or with Enlighten, you may provide us with information about you to help us determine whether you are a good candidate for the role you are applying for. Such information may include your name, phone number, email, resume/CV, availability, references, and more.

We collect information from your browser, computer, mobile device or other device used to access the Enlighten Services. Below we provide examples of the types of data we may collect about you.

#### Location Information

We collect your location information when you provide us with a delivery address or we may use geolocation-based tracking in order to verify your location. For instance, knowing your location may be necessary to allow you full access to our mobile applications or certain aspects of the Enlighten Services. Furthermore, for compliance reasons, some of the Enlighten Services may be restricted depending on where you are located. Collecting your location information is also necessary to connect you to a licensed retailer that operates in your delivery area, to send you relevant content based on your location, and to optimize or improve our products and offerings.

#### Usage Information

We log how you interact with the Enlighten Services, both through your visiting of our website, and through your visit and use of our Third-Party and Retailer partners by automatically recording data sent by your devices or through your visit in person. We also log how you utilize the offerings provided within the Retailer or Third-Party Provider. This includes, but is not limited to, the products and content you view, your actions, how you access our Enlighten Services, through Retailers, and the details of any orders you place or purchases you make.

#### Device Information

We collect information about the device you are using, such as the device’s IP address, web browser, operating system, phone carrier, manufacturer, unique identifiers (such as advertising ID, VIN, MAC address, and IDFA), and other related software or hardware information related to your device.

#### Cookies and Technical Information

We also collect information through the use of “cookies,” tracking pixels, and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files created by websites and stored on your device. They provide a way for the Enlighten Services to recognize you and keep track of your settings and preferences. We also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with a secure experience and to understand, among other things, how you navigate the Enlighten Services, learn what content is popular, recognize repeat users, and save your account information. The Enlighten Services are not configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser settings.

#### Call and Text Information

We work with third-party partners to facilitate phone calls and text messages, including communications between you and your driver. We collect information about such communications, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of any SMS messages. This helps us provide and optimize all services provided to Retailers and Third-Party Providers.

#### User Feedback

We want to make sure you have a consistently positive experience with the Enlighten Services, and we are always looking to improve our products and services. Accordingly, we collect and retain information about any ratings, reviews, and feedback you provide about our service, the Enlighten Services, the products on our site, licensed retailers, and any delivery services.

### Information Collected from Third Parties

#### Public Sources

We may collect information from public sources, such as map information and public social media information.

#### Advertisers

We may receive information about you from our advertisers, such as your interests and preferences to help us provide you with tailored advertisements.

#### Vendors

We may collect information about you directly from our vendor services or tools if your use of their services led to or is related to your use of Enlighten or your job candidacy. For example, if you applied for a job with Enlighten, we may run a background check with a vendor. We may also utilize such services as a means of collecting information from you as described above.
